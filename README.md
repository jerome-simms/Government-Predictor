# US Government Predictor
This is a simple implementationn of "The Keys to The Whitehouse" prediction model
developed by Allan Litchman. This application runs in the command-line and states the
13 keys, allowing the user to either agree or disagree with the statement. Once the
user has entered all of their responses, the application then states whether or not
the incumbent government will remain in power based on the user's responses.

# How to run
This application has no external dependencies and as such can be run using the command:
`python main.py`
